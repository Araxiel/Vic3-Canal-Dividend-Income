Lightweight mod that gives Canals a proper income paid out to you in dividends.<br>

## What this mod does
This mod allows canals (the Suez Canal and Panama Canal) to actually generate a proper revenue, which in turn allows them to generate profits which will be paid out to shareholders. Who those shareholders are, is decided on by the usual ownership production methods found in all buildings. This means the dividends can be paid out to capitalists, or the canals can be government run which yields income to the government, or they can be run as a worker cooperative. There's also a unique ownership model dubbed "Partial Privatization", which splits the profits between the government and capitalists. All those laws are as usual limited to your economic system (no rent seeking canal landlords under the glorious leadership of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat). However like the railways, government run remains an option as long as the system is not laissez-faire.

## How does this mod work
Canals now produce some Transportation, but also a new good called Canal Toll. The latter has a fixed price and abstractly represents the toll collected from passing ships. Both of these goods are being sold for a profit like any other building. The mod is intended to be balanced, so the income isn't too extreme, but also nothing to scoff at either. To offset the "free" revenue, there's a little bit of an increase in goods required, and a PM that further buffs revenue for the price of some steamers. Further, both Government Owned and Partial Privatization both require some bureaucracy to round things out. Canals still give the normal 100 Prestige.

There's no way to actually measure the amount of convoys passing a canal so Canal Tolls are an abstracted measurement (for any fellow modder, I'm aware that theoretically you might be able pull to the amount convoys in nearby trade node as a variable using some ultra-complicated scoping and then adjust it using a hidden reoccurring event, but there's like no documentation for that and that's way too much work).

## Compatibility
This mod is very lightweight and only edits the canal production method "10_canals.txt" and the building file "10_canals.txt", as such it's compatible with anything that doesn't alter canals.

## Can I modify this mod/use the code?
Not only can't really stop anyone from doing that, but I also aren't really opposed to it. However if one takes parts of this mod, give me some credit or message me.
